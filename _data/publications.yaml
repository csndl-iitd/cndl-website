  title: >-
    A survey of neurophysiological differentiation across mouse visual brain
    areas and timescales
  question: >-
    We previously showed that spevtral differentiation can identify specific
    brain areas that might be more involved in subjective perception. How does
    this metric, spectral differentation, depend on the timescale of
    observation, or change from one brain region to another?
  impact: >-
    We used the [Allen Brain Observatory Visul Coding Neuropixels
    dataset](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels)
    to analyze the spectral differentiation of activity of ~50,000 neurons. We
    found that differentiation of single neurons is maximized at a timescale of
    ~100 ms, similar to the timescales of conscious perception; and the
    differentiation of activity of the entire visual cortex most faithfully
    reflects 'conscious perception' compared to individual areas in the visual
    cortex.

  title: Influence of claustrum on cortex varies by area, layer, and cell type
  question: >-
    The claustrum, a centrally connected brain region, has been hypothetized to
    be involved in consciousness. How does the cortex respond to optogenetic
    stimulation of the mouse claustrum?
  impact: >-
    We found that unlike a few similar recent studies that suggest claustrum
    stimulation uniformly inhibits the cortex, claustrum stimulation can
    actually lead to a wide variety of responses in the cortex, depending on the
    cortical area and cell types observed. We characterized these responses in
    depth in this manuscript.

  title: >-
    Measuring stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation in distinct
    populations of neurons in mouse visual cortex
  question: >-
    Decoding is an extrinsic approach - the experimenter knows what is shown to
    the subject, and then asks- activity in what brain region can predict what
    was shown? But what is shown can be very different from what was consciously
    perceived by the subject. Can a new metric (spectral differentiation)
    predict what was consciously seen by the subject?
  impact: >-
    While decoding neural responses from any of the observed visual areas in
    mice can predict what was shown to the mouse, spectral differentiation in
    only specific visual areas (AL, AM) and layers (L2/3) is increased for
    ethologically 'meaningful' compared to 'meaningless' stimuli. Could it
    possibly be predicting what the mouse actually saw, not just what it was
    shown?

  title: >-
    Cooperation mitigates diversity loss in a spatially expanding microbial
    population
  question: >-
    The qualitative differences in the dynamics of pulled and pushed waves (2016
    PNAS paper) has a tremendous impact on how the populations evolve,
    especially how they lose genetic diversity. Can we measure this impact under
    the well controlled conditions in the lab?
  impact: >-
    We demonstrate that pushed waves lose genetic diversity over 100x slower
    than pulled waves! This demonstrates a seriously large fitness advantage to
    populations that grow cooperatively compared to competitively.

    Range expansions transition from pulled to pushed waves as growth becomes
    more cooperative in an experimental microbial population
  question: >-
    Can we predictably vary the local dynamics of a real biological population
    to obtain different types of emergent global dynamics in a controlled
    manner? I studied the eco-evolutionary dynamics in a spatially expanding
    yeast population.
  impact: >-
    We demonstrated the existence of long-predicted pulled and pushed waves in a
    real biological population in a quantitative manner for the first time.

  title: 'Fractional order modified Treves model: Simulation and Learning'
  question: >-
    Can fractional order models capture the long first spike latency and
    downward adaptation of neurons in the Treves model?
  impact: >-
    We show that a fractional order modified Treves model can capture both of
    these features simultaneously, which was not previously observed in simple
    neuron models.

    Interplay between resource dynamics, network structure and spatial
    propagation of transient explosive synchronization in an adaptively coupled
    mouse brain network model
  question: >-
    Epileptic seizures are considered a dynamic disease of brain networks,
    representing a complex interplay between the organization of brain networks
    and the dynamics of metabolic resources. This interplay shapes how seizures
    initiate and spread in the brain. How do the structure of brain networks and
    the dynamics of resource allocation influence the generation and propagation
    of seizures?
  impact: >-
    Understanding seizure dynamics at the whole-brain level is crucial for
    controlling abnormal hypersynchronous activity. Currently, complete brain
    coverage recordings are lacking in both patients and animal models. In this
    study, we investigate seizure dynamics at whole brain level <em>in
    silico</em>. Moreover, our results support existing studies that suggest the
    cortico-thalamic initiation of generalized seizures, with regions primarily
    in the cortex initiating the seizures.
