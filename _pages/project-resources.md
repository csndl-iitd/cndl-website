# Datasets and resources to use for projects

## Mouse datasets
Some of the datasets have corresponding papers associated with them. Going through the papers might give you a better understanding of the data and inspire good questions. These papers often discuss explicitly what was not done and can be done in terms of analysis. That will also give you many ideas.

1. [Allen Visual Coding 2-photon](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-2p): Corresponding [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0550-9). Neurons from the mouse visual cortex were recorded using 2 photon calcium imaging while different videos were shown in front of the mice.
2. [Allen Visual Behavior 2-photon](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-behavior-2p): Corresponding [paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/50340). Almost exactly the same experimental setup as (1), but instead of just showing videos, the mice were now made to perform a task based on visual perception. That way, we know that the mice are actually watching what is being shown. This dataset also includes multi-plane imaging data.
3. [Visual Coding Neuropixels](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels): Corresponding [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03171-x). Similar to (1), but recordings were done using Neuropixels probes (electrophysiology) instead of calcium imaging. You can use (1, 3) to compare the two methods of recording.
4. [Visual Behavior Neuropixels](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/news-press/articles/300000-mouse-neurons-scientists-hope-glean-how-brain-drives-behavior): Same as (2) with Neuropixels recordings.
5. [Other big datasets form Allen Institute](https://portal.brain-map.org/)
6. [International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/#home-new): Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain as they are performing some interesting task.
7. [Datasets from Buzsaki lab](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/database/): Mostly from the mouse hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation (spatial mamory when the mouse is running etc.)
8. I have additional data from the mouse brain (Neuropixels and EEG) under awake and anesthetized conditions.

## Archives with many datasets you can browse through

1. http://neurotycho.org/ Human behavior and neural data
2. https://dandiarchive.org/ Many many datasets, human as well as animal
3. https://openneuro.org/ Many datasets, all human non-invasive modalities
4. https://gin.g-node.org/ Many datasets, all kinds


Note that some of these datasets are huge. But you can start with only a small part, for example only 2 out of 50 mice recordings. If it goes well, we can find ways to get more resources for you.

**[Example projects from NMA that you can use as starting points.](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/projects/docs/project_templates.html)**

_I will update this page with a list of papers that you can try to replicate with a different dataset. Please check back later._
